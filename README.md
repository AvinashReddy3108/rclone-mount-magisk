## Rclone Remount for Android
---

Remount cloud storage locally on boot via rclone & fusermount directly on your Android powered smart device. 

Virtually limitless storage expansion with support for dozens of cloud providers including Dropbox, GDrive, OneDrive, SFTP & many more. Extremely useful for devices without physical storage expansion capabilities. Also great for streaming large media files without need for full caching. Binaries obtained directly from rclone.org. 

We are constantly striving to improve this project & make it the best. If you experience any issues or have suggestions please file them  [HERE](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/com.piyushgarg.rclone/issues). Contributions to this project are welcomed. 

## Features

- Support for arm, arm64, ~~& x86~~

- Huge list of supported cloud storage providers

- Apps with ability to specify paths can access `/mnt/cloud/`

- Most file explorers work just fine ([issue #9](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/com.piyushgarg.rclone/issues/9))

- Mount points use names of remote(s) in rclone.conf

- Specify custom rclone params for each remote via `/sdcard/.rclone/.REMOTE.param`

- Access remotes via [http://127.0.0.1:38762](http://127.0.0.1:38762)

- Access remotes via [ftp://127.0.0.1:38763](ftp://127.0.0.1:38763)

- Mount bind to `/sdcard/` (see [ issue #5](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/com.piyushgarg.rclone/issues/5))

## Configuration (pre-installing)

1. Copy your `rclone.conf` file to `/sdcard/.rclone/rclone.conf` (not required)

2. Add custom params at `/sdcard/.rclone/.*.param` (if needed)

3. Install the module via Magisk Manager

4. Run `rclone config` via term if additional setup required 

4. All your rclone mount points will show up under `/mnt/cloud/` & `/storage/cloud/` or `/sdcard/cloud/`

For more detailed configuration of rclone please refer to [official documentation](https://rclone.org)

## Custom Params

Specification of rclone parameters on a per remote basis can be created inside hidden files ending with the `.param` extension

      /sdcard/.rclone/.*.param

   Where `*` is replaced with name of remote

- Parameters and their default values:

        BUFFERSIZE=0

        CACHEMAXSIZE=1G

        CACHEINFOAGE=30m

        DIRCACHETIME=1h

        ATTRTIMEOUT=30s

        READAHEAD=128k

        CACHEMODE=off

        DISABLE=0

        READONLY=0

        BINDSD=0

        BINDPOINT=

        ADD_PARAMS=

    **NOTE:** _There is no need to specify values you do not wish to change. The above are defaults for all remotes. For more information see [issue #2](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/com.piyushgarg.rclone/issues/2)_

---
## Custom Globals

Specification of global rclone parameters can be created in

      /sdcard/.rclone/.global.param

- Global Specific Parameters

        NET_CHK=google.com

- Excluded Parameters

        BINDPOINT=

   **NOTE:** _Global parameters effect all remotes without `.*.parm` files containing opposing values. Some parameters are specific to globals while others have been excluded_

---
## Known Issues

- VLC  takes a long time to load media as it opens file in write mode when using it's internal browser. 

   a. Create remote type alias for media dirs in rclone.conf and specify `CACHEMODE=off` in `/sdcard/.rclone/.ALIASNAME.param`

- Encrypted devices can not mount until unlock

- Encrypted `rclone.conf` causes reboots

- High cpu/mem in some apps with storage perms ([issue #9](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/com.piyushgarg.rclone/issues/9))
- The `fusermount` bin may not be compatible on all devices (see  [thread](https://www.google.com/amp/s/forum.xda-developers.com/android/development/fusermount-android-rclone-mount-t3866652/amp/))
